{"name":"Aws-boto-scripts","tagline":"Scripts for AWS in Python Using Boto","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis repo contains scripts written in Pythin using boto that are useful in managing an AWS account. Feel free to pitch in.\r\n\r\n**backup-manager** a folder in this repo, contains two scripts that are used for managing backups for an AWS account. \r\n* **createImagesBasedOnTags.py** - It creates an image (ami) of all the instances that have tag \"_AutomaticBackup_\" with value \"_True_\" `{\"AutomaticBackup\":\"True\"}`. One can also specify another tag \"_Frequency_\", which counts the number of ami required for an instance. \r\n\r\n* **Frequency** tag is helpful when you need to create more than one backup in a day, for that you will also need to run this script more than once according to the frequency that you need.\r\n\r\n* It also tags the resultant ami with following tags `{\"instance_id\":\"<actual-instance-id>\"}` (helps in searching).\r\n\r\n* **deleteBackupsBasedOnTags-backupManager.py** - It deletes the older images if the instances which have tag `{\"AutomaticBackup\":\"True\"}`. By default it deletes images older than 30 days. This number can be customized by by another tag \"_RetentionCount_\" `{\"RetentionCount\":45}`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nHitesh Bhatia (@hiteshBhatia)\r\nVikash Jha (@91vikash)\r\nAakash Garg (@aakash21)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
